# Project description
# infogration-rest

This project is a RESTful WebService, which will be used for the infogration-project (More on this later). Infogration is an android app, which I developed in a previous class in Germany, at this moment looking for funding to establish as a startup. 
This service stores the data which will be requested (get) by the Android-App, and updated (update/post/delete) by another webservice from responsible persons via GUI. Here we only care about the data-storage REST-service as this needs to run permanently in the cloud, in order to allow continous content upgrades to the users of the app.

The content that is being queried are **Content** instances, where each instance has as **Question** and **Answer** instance.
