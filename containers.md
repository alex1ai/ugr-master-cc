# Installation of docker

As I am working on a fedora machine, I am using [this](https://docs.docker.com/install/linux/docker-ce/fedora/#install-using-the-repository) guide of installing docker via repository.

Next I am starting the docker daemon via `$ sudo systemctl start docker` and I verfy that everything is running with

`$ sudo docker run hello-world`

After this returns correctly, we are ready to use it.
