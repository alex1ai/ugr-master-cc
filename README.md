An explanation of this project's content can be found [here](https://github.com/alex1ai/ugr-master-cc/blob/doc/doc/project_description.md)



## Tools 

- This project will use Docker as a container system to enable easy shipping on different possible servers
- Furthermore it will be a WebService providing a REST-API. This will be written in Go 
- Content must be available in different languages, this means for one instance of a Text, we need to store different translations. Therefore data-storage needs to be efficient about language storage and changes.
- As the first concern should always be security, different microservices and framework will be used for authentication, data storage and requests. 

(I wanted to use Docker and Go for a long time, let's try these trends)
