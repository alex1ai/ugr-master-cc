# infogration-backend

The usage and routes of the most recent version is documented [here](https://github.com/alex1ai/ugr-master-cc/blob/gh-pages/usage.md).

## Description

This project is a RESTful WebService, which will be used for _infogration_, an Android app, which I developed in a previous class in Germany.
It answers the most important questions asked by refugees coming to Germany. Questions range from job-hunting, housing to everyday-life. The content is created by mentors of Diakonie WÃ¼rzburg, an institution which works with young refugees on a daily basis.
At the moment all the questions and answers are hard-coded in the application, which is undesirable as changes should be made by other persons, too. 

## Local Installation and execution

I assume you already have a valid go working directory structure. 
Further do you need a running MongoDB-server somewhere - by default it will look at localhost:27017.
Then you can run the following:
```bash
go get https://github.com/alex1ai/ugr-master-cc
cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/alex1ai/ugr-master-cc
go build & ./ugr-master-cc
```
which will start the service locally on 0.0.0.0:3000 by default. Set environment variables $API_IP and/or $API:PORT to change.

## Architecture

This service stores the data which will be requested (get) by the Android-App, and updated (update/post/delete) by another webservice from responsible persons via GUI. Here we only care about the data-handling REST-service as this needs to run permanently in the cloud, in order to allow continous content upgrades to the users of the app.

### Highlights:
- Microservice-based in order to have good maintainability and seperation of concerns.
- Go REST-API for communication with App and GUI, I use [Gorilla Mux](https://github.com/gorilla/mux) router as this is the mostly used one in Go. (Service #1)
- NoSQL data storage service with MongoDB, will run as a stand-alone service (Serivce #2)
- Authentication of users to edit/add/delete content (Middleware)

## Deployment
Deployment https://infogration.now.sh

While there are different PaaS deployment services out there, I chose [zeit.co](https://zeit.co/) as it offers nice tutorials and a lightweight deployment mechanism. Furthermore it offers integration of Docker (i.e. I can use any language I want besides Node/JS, which others offer exclusively), CI-support of Travis for automatic testing, and Github-Integration which deploys by pushing to master (if configured this way). 
**No configuration is needed** if you want to use Now. Everything is build automatically and aliased as _infogration_ if someone pushes to master or via Pull Requests. 
Deployment through _Now_ is part of **Travis** execution after it passed all tests. If the tests fail, there will be no new deployment.

## Provision

### Using GUI of Azure

For easy provisioning on any virtual machine of this webservice, I chose Ansible for its configuration management. Ansible works, in contrast to e.g. Puppet, in a push-way and is a good choice for this kind of project because one doesn't need to install anything on the Client-vm.   
This Project is deployed in Microsoft's Azure cloud with a low-resourced VM. 
How to provision to your cloud and more information about the chosen configuration can be found [here](https://github.com/alex1ai/ugr-master-cc/blob/gh-pages/provision.md). 

MV: 40.89.159.84

### Automatic provision via script

As of milestone 4, we can create VMs in Azure automatically via `acopio.sh`. [This](https://github.com/alex1ai/ugr-master-cc/blob/gh-pages/cli-provisioning.md) provides all the documentation and justification for the chosen image, ressources and location. Currently the server is running on Ubuntu 16.04 LTS in France-Central on a cheap Azure virtual machine (B1s).

MV2: 40.89.159.84

## Orchestration via Vagrant

Vagrant is a controller to create and manage virtual machines from command line. For milestone #5 I added the option to start virtual machines via this tool. Therefore I made to different versions:

  1. [Start webservice locally in 2 VMs](./orquestacion/local/Vagrantfile)
  2. [Start webservice in Azure subscription](./orquestacion/Vagrantfile)
  
More information and documentation is given [here](https://github.com/alex1ai/ugr-master-cc/blob/gh-pages/vagrant_provision.md).

Despliegue Vagrant: 20.188.38.46

## Containers

The project can be deployed with Docker (docker-compose) and the service api is deployed as an image on [Docker Hub](https://cloud.docker.com/repository/docker/alexgrimm/infogration-backend) as well.

If you had docker-compose locally installed you can directly start everything with the provided docker-compose.yml. 
You can also run the service with `sudo docker run --rm -e MONGO_IP={IP of running MongoDB} alexgrimm/infogration-backend` if you have a MongoDB running somewhere.

Everything about the containers and how to run them is documented [here](https://github.com/alex1ai/ugr-master-cc/blob/gh-pages/containers.md).

Contenedor: TODO
